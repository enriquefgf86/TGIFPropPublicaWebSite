          Openness, accountability, and honesty define government
          transparency. In a free society, transparency is government's
          obligation to share information with citizens. It is at the heart of
          how citizens hold their public officials accountable. Here at TGIF
          we believe that government should be transparent.
        </p>
        <p>
          Governments exist to serve the people. Information on how officials
          conduct the public business and spend taxpayer money must be readily
          available and easily understood. This transparency allows good and
          just governance. Transparency promotes accountability and provides
          information for citizens about what their Government is doing.
        </p>
        <p>
          We also believe that government should be participatory. Public
          engagement enhances the Government's effectiveness and improves the
          quality of its decisions. Knowledge is widely dispersed in society,
          and public officials benefit from having access to that dispersed
          knowledge. We invite you to use our site to become actively engaged
          in American government.
        </p>
        <p>
          TGIF works to disclose information in forms that the public can
          readily find and use. We solicit public feedback to identify
          information of greatest use to the public.

        <h3>Background History of Government Transparency</h3>
        <p><span id="dots">...</span></p>
        <div id="more">
          <p>
            In the West, the idea that government should be open to public
            scrutiny and susceptible to public opinion dates back at least to
            the time of the Enlightenment, when many philosophes made an
            attack on absolutist doctrine of state secrecy, a core part of
            their intellectual project. The passage of formal legislative
            instruments to this end can also be traced to this time with
            Sweden, for example, (which then included Finland as a
            Swedish-governed territory) enacting free press legislation as
            part of its constitution (Freedom of the Press Act, 1766). This
            approach, and that of the philosophes more broadly, is strongly
            related to recent historiography on the eighteenth-century public
            sphere.
          </p>

          <p>
            Influenced by Enlightenment thought, the revolutions in America
            (1776) and France (1789), freedom of the press enshrined
            provisions and requirements for public budgetary accounting and
            freedom of the press in constitutional articles. In the nineteenth
            century, attempts by Metternichean statesmen to row back on these
            measures were vigorously opposed by a number of eminent liberal
            politicians and writers, Bentham, Mill and Acton prominent among
            the latter.
          </p>

          <p>
            Open government is widely seen to be a key hallmark of
            contemporary democratic practice and is often linked to the
            passing of freedom of information legislation. Scandinavian
            countries claim to have adopted the first freedom of information
            legislation, dating the origins of its modern provisions to the
            eighteenth century and Finland continuing the presumption of
            openness after gaining independence in 1917, passing its Act on
            Publicity of Official Documents in 1951 (superseded by new
            legislation in 1999).
          </p>

          <p>
            The United States passed its Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) in
            1966, FOIAs, Access to Information Acts (AIAs) or equivalent laws
            were passed in Denmark and Norway in 1970.
